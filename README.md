# Basic C# Game - 1
 
This is the first basic game I did in C#: a car game.

The player controls a car and has to dodge the other cars that come from his front. Every few seconds the speed of the other cars grows and the player will find a harder time to dodge them.
There is also a score system and when the player crashes the score will come up.
