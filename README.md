# Basic C# Game - 1
 
This is the first basic game I did in C#.

The player control a crossbow and can shoot a maximum of 2 arrows at the monsters that are attacking him.
If he misses both of his shots he has to wait a few second before he can shot again, but if he manages to hit a creature he gets the arrow back.
There's also a score system and if he lets 3 monsters touch the wall in front of him, the player will lose and the score will show up.
